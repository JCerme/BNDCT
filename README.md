This website was developed as a practice assignment for the Web Development course at Coderhouse.

It has several fairly complete sections that can be easily navigated. It is fully responsive throughout the website and I even incorporated an animation library called "AOS Library", which I recommend.

First, I developed a detailed design sketch in Figma and once I found the perfect style, I integrated it into HTML and SASS. All images have been optimized and edited to meet the brand identity I wanted to represent.

The integrated Javascript is very basic, just to give it a custom cursor and make the menu responsive.

## ðŸ›  Skills Utilizadas
HTML, CSS, SASS y Javascript 

## ðŸ“–â€ŠWhat I Have Learned?

In this project, I learned a lot about SASS since I had never had the opportunity to use or learn it before. It was my first project with SASS and I am very happy and proud of the result. On the other hand, it was a very complete course that covered topics such as SEO, FTP, or the use of some CSS libraries like Bootstrap.
